= The Twelve Factors
:toc: left
:icons: font

== I. https://12factor.net/codebase[Codebase]

> One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

image::https://12factor.net/images/codebase-deploys.png[Codebase vs deploys]

* [ ] under VCS
* [ ] one codebase by app

== II. Dependencies

> Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

* [ ] Source dependency management
** `package.json`, `requirement.txt`, `Cargo.toml`,...
* [ ] Environment dependency management
** `Vagrantfile`, `Dockerfile`, `VirtualEnv`,...

== III. Config

> Store config in the environment

* [ ] Strict separation of config from code
* [ ] Can you open source at any moment without compromising any credentials?
* [ ] Usage of environment variables
** [ ] Separated config file for SPA

== IV. Backing services

> Treat backing services as attached resources

image::https://12factor.net/images/attached-resources.png[Backing services]

* [ ] swap out a database without changing the app's code
* [ ] link frontend to another backend without changing the app's code

== V. Build, release, run

> Strictly separate build and run stages

image::https://12factor.net/images/release.png[build release and run]

* [ ] Release have a unique id
* [ ] __build stage__ converts code into executable bundle without config
* [ ] __release stage__ combines bundle with deploy's current config
* [ ] __run stage__  runs the app in the execution environment

== VI. Processes

> Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

* [ ] No sticky sessions
* [ ] Datastore with time-expiration (Memcached, redis,...)
* [ ] shared-nothing architecture

== VII. Port binding

> Export services via port binding

* [ ] backend exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port
* [ ] frontend applications are bundled with their own http server
* [ ] development environment comes with their own servers

== VIII. Concurrency

> Scale out via the process model

image::https://12factor.net/images/process-types.png[process types]

* [ ] Rely on operating system's process manager (systemd, ..)
* [ ] Can have multiple instances at the same time

== IX. Disposability

> Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

* [ ] Shutdown gracefully on SIGTERM
* [ ] Handle sudden death
* [ ] Startup time takes a few seconds

== X. Dev/prod parity

> Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible


|===
||Traditional app |Twelve-factor app

|*Time between deploys*
|Weeks
|Hours

|*Code authors vs code deployers*
|Different people
|Same people

|*Dev vs production environments*
|Divergent
|As similar as possible
|===

* 3 gaps:

** *The time gap*: Time between dev to production
** *The personnel gap*: Developers write code, ops engineers deploy it.
** *The tools gap*: Using nginx on dev and Apache in production


* [ ] Time between dev and prod < few days
* [ ] Backend services are the same used in production
** [ ] Same versions?


== XI. Logs

> Treat logs as event streams

* [ ] Output logs to stdout
* [ ] Does not write or manage logfiles

== XII. Admin processes

> Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

* [ ] Access to a REPL
